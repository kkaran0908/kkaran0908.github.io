        <h3 class="text-center">Why You Should Appear in the GATE CSE</h3>
        <div class="text-justify">
          <p>Gate computer science is one of the most sought exams if we talk about Computer Science and Engineering. Because of its usefulness, competition in GATE CSE is increasing every year. Every year at least 1 lakh student appears for Gate Computer Science. In this blog, we will talk about why we should plan to appear in the GATE and start preparing for the GATE as soon as possible. What may be the long term and short term benefits of appearing in GATE? </p>
          
          <h4>Enhancement in Core Computer Science Knowledge:</h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px">If you are appearing for GATE and preparing for the exam very rigorously. I can bet, your technical knowledge of various computer science areas such as Operating System, Computer Networks, DBMS, Computer Architecture is going to be really good. Although you will be learning very old things, still you can relate to every subject with today’s computers. If one is appearing for the interview of some product-based companies such as Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm, etc, there will be at least one round where you will be asked in-depth questions from these subjects. So in that scenario, knowledge of these subjects is going to be highly helpful for you.  </p>

          <h4>Desire to Get into IITs/IISc:</h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px">There are some students, who has a burning desire to enter into IITs/IISc and During JEE could not fulfill their dream, for such people GATE provides a golden opportunity to fulfill their dream to study in such premier institutes.</p>

          <h4>Public Sector Unit (PSUs) Jobs:</h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px">Although PSUs are famous among the students of core engineering branches such as Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, etc. But a computer science student can also go for PSUs, we just need to get a good rank mostly under 100. Initial salary and perks in PSUs are really good. But most of the students with that much rank generally prefer to go for IITs or IISc for Masters. So PSUs are a really good option for a computer science student. </p>

          
          <h4>Awesome Career Post M.Tech/ME: </h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px">If we talk about normal private colleges, most of the students get placed in service-based companies. These companies do not pay good enough to live a lavish life in a metro city. But once you enter into the IIT system and that too with the computer science branch. Your life is going to be changed completely. Its a fact that almost all the IITs except a few new ones, most of them have an average placement of 15+ lakh per annum. Now think about a scenario, you are a 23-24 years old unmarried guy and earning 15+ LPA. You yourself can not imagine, how you and your parent’s life is going to change. For 90% of the student, it is the biggest motivation and it should be.</p>

          <h4>Your Brand Value in the Society/Market: </h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px">All the people who did not take you seriously, now they will take you seriously. The answer you are going to write over quora, LinkedIn post, etc are going to get a lot many numbers of likes/upvotes (don’t know about Facebook). Some of the companies or coaching institutes may approach you for the paid promotion over these platforms.</p>

          <h4>The happiness of Your Parents: </h4>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px"> In this world, there are only 2 people who loves you more than anything else in the world and those two people are your parents. Once you clear the GATE, the happiness that you are going to see on there face is just an unique experience. Now they are going to tell people proudly that their son/daughter is studying/working in such an Institute/Organization. It happens with me, whenever I go to my home and if there is any family gathering, my parents proudly say that our son is the student of an IIT. You can clearly see the happiness and satisfaction on their faces.</p>
