     <li><h3> Microsoft Malware Detection Using Machine Learning</h3></li>
    <p> 
       <ol style = "line-height:2">
         <li>It is a case study in which I was given nine types of malware in the form of .asm and .byte files.
              Using machine learning i have to make a model in which, given a .asm/.byte file i have to predict to which category this malware belongs to.
            I used Logistic Regression, KNN,  XgBoost Classifier, Random Forest to classify the malware. XgBoost 
           was giving the highest accuracy of more then 98%. Data set can be found here : <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data">
